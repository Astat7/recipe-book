# SMARTCOOK PROJECT - Recipe book template
## Sidebar
Sidebar contains options for filtering and sorting the main menu. It is on the left side, but is still considerably big to be easily noticable.

On PC mode it stays on the same place even after menu is scrolled, but has it's own scroll bar.

On tablet mode it is on the top of the website. It was originally ment to be togglable by a "filters" button in a corner but I did not manage to do that succesfully.
## Menu
Menu displays recipes. It occupies most of the screen to catch people's sight.

On tablet mode it is on the bottom of the website
### Recipes
Recipe shows it's name, price and difficulty. Further information can be viewed by pressing the dropdown button. This was made to show the importnant information first and if a user is interested, they can view the rest.
## Misc
Div with id "temp" serves as a temporary storage for recipes. Recipes during sorting are all put into this div and then put back into the menu in a sorted order.
